# User Authentication and Authorization System

## Overview

This project is a fully functional User Authentication and Authorization system built using FastAPI, Pydantic, and MongoDB. It demonstrates how to securely manage user sign-ups, logins, and role-based access control using JWT tokens. This system is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, making it suitable for integration into any modern web application.

## Features <br>
User Registration: Allows new users to register by providing a username, email, and password. <br>
User Login: Authenticates users based on their credentials and generates a secure JWT token for session management.  <br>
JWT Authentication: Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to handle user sessions securely and ensure stateless authentication. <br>
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Provides role-based access control to different parts of the application, enabling fine-grained permission settings. <br>
Password Hashing: Uses industry-standard hashing algorithms to securely store user passwords. <br>
API Documentation: Interactive API documentation provided via Swagger UI, auto-generated by FastAPI.

## Technologies Used <br>
FastAPI: For creating a high-performance, modern web API with Python. <br>
Pydantic: For data validation and serialization using Python's type annotations. <br>
MongoDB: As the database for storing user information, including credentials and roles. <br>
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure, stateless authentication.
