User Authentication and Authorization System
Overview
This project is a fully functional User Authentication and Authorization system built using FastAPI, Pydantic, and MongoDB. It demonstrates how to securely manage user sign-ups, logins, and role-based access control using JWT tokens. This system is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, making it suitable for integration into any modern web application.

Features
User Registration: Allows new users to register by providing a username, email, and password.
User Login: Authenticates users based on their credentials and generates a secure JWT token for session management.
JWT Authentication: Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to handle user sessions securely and ensure stateless authentication.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Provides role-based access control to different parts of the application, enabling fine-grained permission settings.
Password Hashing: Uses industry-standard hashing algorithms to securely store user passwords.
API Documentation: Interactive API documentation provided via Swagger UI, auto-generated by FastAPI.
Technologies Used
FastAPI: For creating a high-performance, modern web API with Python.
Pydantic: For data validation and serialization using Python's type annotations.
MongoDB: As the database for storing user information, including credentials and roles.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure, stateless authentication.
